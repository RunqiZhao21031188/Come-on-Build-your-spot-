This is a game with a combination of unity and leap motion that has a building function through hand movements. In the game, the player can choose different scenarios. We have set up four scenes: kindergarten, office scene, park and community. Each scene is built and rendered by blender. Before each scene we interspersed dialogue to help the player immerse themselves in the scene. In the scenes we set up 10 different styles of modules that the player can grab and move through hand grasping movements and keyboard to achieve the module overlay function. We have also set up the button to add modules in each environment through c#, dropping modules in order according to the display show board in the scenes. In addition to the added module can be modify color by clicking on a button.

During the design process, the visual effect of text appearing word by word in the dialog box took a long time, and we also encountered some difficulties in setting up the border of collider and camera view  . These problems were solved by learning from the videos and with the help of fellow students.
The game did not have a specific goal and the way it was played was defined by the players themselves. So in the exhibition, the participants hacked more ways for the game.

Before that we tried to make a narrative game and spent a lot of time on organising the story, characterisation, skeleton binding and mini-games demo. We changed the plan because of the amount of work involved, and we will continue to try later~


## Inspiration
During the group brainstorming, we took the daily life status and needs of the people around us as the key to the research, and found that most people feel the pressure of the environment and their own anxiety in the trivial daily life, and everyone is eager to seek a relaxing  Way.  One of our group members, undergraduate major was environmental design,she is more aware of the psychological effects of the environment. So that we came up with the idea of designing an interactive game with LeapMotion.  Its purpose is to enhance the understanding and communication between people and the environment, and relieve people's stress and anxiety in the environment.  Starting from this design concept that we agreed on as the key, we also agreed on the story of the characters and the cute and healing style of the game, and started our teamwork journey.
